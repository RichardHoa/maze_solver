# Maze Solver Project

This project is a maze solver implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. Although Python is not traditionally considered the best language for OOP, it offers sufficient flexibility for this project.

## Features

- Solves mazes of various sizes.
- Adjustable maze size via Python code.
- Visual representation of the maze and the solver's progress.

## Installation

To run the maze solver, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RichardHoa/maze_solver
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd maze-solver
    ```
   
3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

## How It Works

- Upon running the program, a maze will be displayed.
- After a 5-second delay, the maze solver will begin navigating and solving the maze.

## Usage

Adjust the maze size and other parameters directly in the Python code as needed. The solver will automatically adapt to changes in the maze configuration.
